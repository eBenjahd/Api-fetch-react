# API Fetch React

This project is a simple React app that demonstrates how to fetch data from an API using `fetch`. The main goal is to show how API requests work in React rather than building a polished UI.  

## Features
- Fetch data from a public API
- Display results dynamically
- Basic React components & hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
